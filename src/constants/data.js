            <p>As our first project, we are working on a patch of the riverfront near Mhatre Bridge, where a nallah discharges wastewater into the river.</p>
            <p>This is the current situation of the stretch we are going to work on. The problems include solid waste dumping, wastewater discharge, stagnant water, lack of plants, foul odour, and mosquito breeding. This project aims at cleaning and beautification of the nallah before it is discharged into the river.</p>
            <p>The aesthetics of the nallah will be improved using eco-friendly, low-cost and low-maintenance interventions. These interventions will include regulation of water flow, removal of solid waste and plantation of native trees. This will facilitate discharge of treated clean water, with increased dissolved oxygen at the spot before entering into the Mutha river.</p>
            <p>The team has already begun working on this project from 9th January 2022. Let's join them and come together to begin the change!</p>
